build
=====

* Bump library versions for metadata

mpi-base
========

Still needed to encapsulate JASMIN specific bindings.

* Build from (latest?) petebunting/au-eoed(-dev) container? - EO/PB to establish version, otherwise build from arcsi-base
* sysconfigdata-conda-user.py -- is this hack still needed?
* arcsimpi.py -- any updates?


workflow
========

* /app/workflows/requirements.txt -- probable version updates

EO team
=======

* Deterimine appropriate versions of arcsi and gdal to use - This will probably require input from devs to build vms for testing
